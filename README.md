CCOJSONManager
==============


CCOJSONManager is a barebones manager class for use in downloading a flat JSON file and storing it in a singleton. The features are very minimal, as this is more of a template or a starting point for a more robust data manager. 

The HTTP Request is done through AFNetworking and the AFJSONRequestOperation class, which can be found here:
